# AllTreks

--------------------------------------

https://alltreks.herokuapp.com


AllTreks is a clone of AllTrails.com, where users can find detailed information about hikes they are interested in, as well as add reviews and photos of hikes they have completed. A hike page can give information such as difficulty, length, route type, waypoints, weather conditions, driving directions, and even a map of the hike.

The AllTreks backend is built using the Ruby on Rails framework, and PostgreSQL database. The frontend of the site it built using React and CSS, with Redux managing the front-end state.
